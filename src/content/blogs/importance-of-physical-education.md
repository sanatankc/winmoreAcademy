  We’ve often heard people stress the importance of physical education, how
  important it is really? As parents, we often place higher importance to grades
  and ranks however for your child to grow holistically it is important for you
  as a parent to teach them to have the right balance between academics and
  sports.


  With everything being shifted into a hybrid model, kids need to destress from
  their screens and focus on their mind and body. Despite virtual classes,
  Glentree Academy has made a constant effort to conduct virtual physical
  educational activities for their kids


  ### We must now move into understanding the importance of physical education.


  **Let me list them down for you quickly:**


  1. Increased concentration and focus.

  2. Fights child obesity.

  3. Better Quality of Sleep.

  4. Relieves Stress.

  5. Reduces levels of depression and anxiety.

  6. Increase leadership skills and teamwork.

  7. Positive Body Image.

  8. Self Discipline.

  9. Boosts Confidence.

  10. Develops Motor Skills and Improves Behaviour


  ### Increased Concentration And Focus


  It’s hard to deal with your child’s tantrums while studying or doing any other
  chores. Studies have proven that students who play sports or who are involved
  in physical or fitness activities have increased levels of concentration and
  focus. With this renewed energy and concentration levels it positively impacts
  on all arenas of their lives including academics. Students who are athletic in
  nature are highly alert and efficient and effective in academics.


  ### Fights Child Obesity


  Times have definitely changed and that holds good for our food habits too.
  Children often get addicted to flashy junk foods, canned and processed foods,
  sodas and carbonated drinks. These foods are termed “unhealthy” and ultimately
  leads to child obesity. We all do understand the many health problems that are
  associated with the consumption of these unhealthy foods. Hence only with
  regular exercise implemented from childhood, a child will turn out to be a
  healthy individual.


  ### Better Quality Of Sleep


  It is a well-known fact that students who exercise regularly have a better
  quality of sleep. With decent levels of sleep, it increases a student’s
  concentration level and highly improves their attention span.


  ### Relieves Stress


  It is an undeniable fact that kids and teens today are under high pressure
  than anyone else. With their virtual classes, recurring assignments and being
  stuck within four walls only adds to more pressure. The only way from them to
  escape this pressure is to engage in physical activities. It helps them to
  take a break from their usual routine for a while and destress themselves.


  ### Reduces Anxiety And Depression


  Depression and anxiety have become two extremely common words for Gen-Z kids.
  These words have lost their original meaning and have turned as mere tags to
  brand kids. As parents, we often forget to understand that depression and
  anxiety come in many forms. One way to ensure that kids don’t fall into these
  traps is to ensure that they step away from their homes and step their foot in
  nature and perform some fitness activities. Every child needs to be physically
  active to keep their mental health on track.


  ### Teamwork And Leadership Skills


  In order to be a leader, you must be a good team player. Only if an individual
  is able to cooperate and be a part of a great team, he or she will
  automatically be a great leader of a team. One way to instil these qualities
  of teamwork and leadership is to encourage children to participate in sports.
  It helps young people to improve their leadership skills and teaches them how
  to be spirited as a team or a community. Through physical exercises, students
  learn how to make and break bonds between their peers and this creates a
  healthy dynamic between the children. With teamplay, kids are more concerned
  not only about themselves but also their fellow mates and this brings about a
  community spirit amongst them. With values like these being sown into them at
  a very young age, they are sure to turn out to be great citizens of the
  country.


  ### Positive Body Image


  Body-shaming and defaming based on physical appearance is at its highest now.
  People have turned intolerant towards each other and pass harsh comments by
  making others feel insecure. It is highly important for everyone who promotes
  body image to promote physical activities as it is the only way through which
  an individual can look happy, feel good and right about themselves and their
  body. Especially women and girls have been constantly for their looks and
  appearance. Hence with this societal pressure to look in a specified way,
  physical activities are of utmost importance.


  ### Self Discipline


  The most important outcome of physical education is the discipline an
  individual acquires. Sports teaches children to implement this self control in
  all aspects of their life, from better controlling their emotions to being
  more self motivated with their studies.


  ### Boosts Confidence


  Physical Education helps children to develop a sense of confidence in
  themselves. This can have a positive aspect in all areas of their life, such
  as their personal relationships and ability to integrate quickly and make
  friends, to think about their future goals.


  ### Develops Motor Skills


  Sports and other physical activities help children develop their motor skills
  and strengthen their muscles. When fine motor skills are developed, through
  sports children will be more adept at handwriting or playing a musical
  instrument of their choice.


  ### Improved Behaviour


  Several experiments have shown us that through sports you can improve the
  behaviour of your child.

  activities, they are;

  mobility, and body consumption.

  3. Improves power, agility, reaction, time, balance, speed and coordination by
  use of all senses.

  5. Children learn and practise motor skills in a safe environment. This allows
  for satisfying and successful participation in physical activities like an
  individual and team sports.

  6. Regular physical activity helps to release tension and anxiety. It also
  helps to build resilience and emotional stability.

  7. As children master skills they become more confident in their abilities.
