  How many times have we heard students asking, “Why do we learn calculus or
  theorems? Where do we apply or use it in the real world?” And honestly, it’s a
  great question–one that we should all spend more time thinking about.


  Research shows that relevant learning means effective learning and is most
  enduring. The age-old chalk and talk method don’t hold an interest in today’s
  restless, curious and overindulged children. They need relevant, meaningful
  activities to engage them emotionally and connect with what they already know.


  For years teachers and students have had to struggle with how to teach and how
  to learn. When we were growing up, we all had a few teachers who were
  favourites and few whom we were not too fond of. In fact, our interest in
  certain subjects was just because of the way it was taught by the teacher. In
  those days the focus was on rote learning or as they say ‘The Drill and Kill’
  method.


  The biggest challenge that our society faces due to these teaching methods is
  that people with formal education lack skills and people with skills lack
  formal education. Thus we have electrical engineers with degrees dependant on
  electricians without degrees to fix their fans or mixer grinder. This limits
  the growth of both of them. The role of a good curriculum is to bridge this
  gap and ensure that knowledge and skill go hand in hand.


  Gardner (1983) pioneer in the field of multiple intelligence theory, in his
  long time effort in educational reform has showed that education based on
  multiple intelligences of children and their active involvement as one of the
  important factors in effective learning.


  Now we know that we all have a way in which we learn best, either through
  observing, listening, or touch. Odds are that each and every one of our
  children has a different way that they learn best, too. That is why it is
  essential for every school to have a curriculum which uses various teaching
  strategies to appeal to each of these different learning styles and provide
  the children with a unique experience that will meet all of their needs.


  The curriculum should be designed in such a way that it is broad and balanced
  and should aim at providing the children with not just knowledge but all
  skills and understanding to help them develop into well informed, confident
  and responsible individuals. We at Glentree Academy achieve this by making
  digital content, tinkering labs and multiple projects an integral part of our
  Learning for Life (LFL) curriculum.


  Multiple ways of teaching a concept and coming to a correct conclusion, help
  to reach out to the whole class and encourages developing a conceptual
  framework as well as problem-solving skills. It helps in introducing, holding
  attention and reinforcing the concepts to every individual.


  “Too often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to
  solve.”
